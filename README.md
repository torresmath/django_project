This is a project based on the Django course made by Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI)

It's a simple application that explores a collection of features the Django framework offers, such as:

- Rest API creation
- In memory database and database migrations
- Django's built in admin/user management library
- Creation of HTML pages with Django Templates
